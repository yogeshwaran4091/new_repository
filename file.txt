There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> main

PS E:\robot\gitcheck> git pull origin master
fatal: couldn't find remote ref master
PS E:\robot\gitcheck> git pull --rebase origin
You asked to pull from the remote 'origin', but did not specify
a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
PS E:\robot\gitcheck> git pull --rebase main  
fatal: 'main' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
PS E:\robot\gitcheck> git branch              
* main
PS E:\robot\gitcheck> git pull origin main
fatal: couldn't find remote ref main
PS E:\robot\gitcheck> git push origin main
